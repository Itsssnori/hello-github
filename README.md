# hello-github
This is my first use and edit of github. I purposely recorded this so that if a time comes when I'm already good at progammming, I can look back and appreciate how far I progressed.
Currently, I don't have any tech stack at my disposal, but I'm currently learning a high programming language called C++ and I'm getting a hang of it. I have my eyes on becoming a software engineer/architect, or a cloud engineering in the future.
To me that is reading this right now, how is the progress?
