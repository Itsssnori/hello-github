# hello-github ðŸ‘¾
First time using GitHub â€” just trying things out.  
Expect a few mistakes (or a lot, honestly).  
Iâ€™ll figure it out as I go.  

Figured Iâ€™d drop this as a bookmark. 
Something to look back on once I actually know what Iâ€™m doing and laugh at how it all started.  
For now, itâ€™s all part of the process.

Stick around if you want. Or donâ€™t. Itâ€™s chill.
